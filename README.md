# Strapi
About Acornfile for running Strapi on Acorn.

## Deploy the Strapi App 

You can deploy the sample web app on the Acorn SaaS Platform to test the Application.

## Strapi Acornfile

Let us have a close look at the Acornfile and see what is defined:

- **Containers**: These containers will be deployed for running Strapi. We have two containers, one for Strapi and the other for MySQL. We are setting the environment variables returned from the MariaDB Acorn service for the Strapi container.
- **Services**: Acorn services are external services your application can utilize. In this case, we use the [MariaDB Acorn service](https://github.com/acorn-io/mariadb/pkgs/container/mariadb).

## Steps

1. Login into the Acorn SaaS Platform using the Github Sign-In option with your Github user.
2. You can select the "Create Acorn" option to create new Acorns and deploy your Application.
3. Choose the source for deploying your Acorns
  * Select "From Acorn Image" to deploy the sample Application and select its Image
  * Provide any random name such as `web-app` and keeping Project's default Region, type in the below Acorn image and choose Create 
    ```bash
    ghcr.io/rohitg00/strapi-mariadb:latest
    ```
4. the sample App is now provisioned on the Acorn SaaS Platform and is available for **up to 2 hours**.
5. The Strapi container expects me to set up the **admin user** from localhost and not over the Internet. Hence, I’ll forward the local host to 1337 port. Run the below command for the same.
   ```bash
    acorn port-forward strapi-mariadb 1337
   ```
7. Use the `http://localhost:1337` to set up the Strapi website on your browser.
